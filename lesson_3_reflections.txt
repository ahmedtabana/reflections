When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I have many people working on the project.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I'm not sure why, maybe because we might have things that we don't need. conflicts that we need to take care of.
