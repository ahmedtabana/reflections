What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

when I initialize a git repository using git init. I get a .git hidden file on my directory (meta data for history). I can view .git files using ls -a. I can then use git status. I need to do this in order to be able to track versions of my files. 

If I use git log and get an error
fatal: bad default revision head.

git init: 
creates a git respository, and creates the .git files. 

git status: 
shows the status of all the files on the repository

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

staging area is an intermidate stage that allows us to choose what files in the directory we wish to commit.
